/*
[WORLD] (example - 10,20)
okay so entities have a xy pos in the world. 
Use this to calculate distances between entities 
or whatever â€“ not hella useful in the game layer.
Youll wanna to apply zoom and get absolute pixels

[ABSOLUTE] (example - 200,400)
You can use these for anything relative to entities.
However theres also a viewport that can be panned.
this translates the position by another xy pixels. 
Use this to locate a characters world coordinates in
a way where you can run calculation on screen

[VIEWPORT] (example -50, 60)
You always wanna draw at viewport position, 
this is tricky. Also not super true bc the map
for example uses a tile system that idk how it maps 
to anything yet it just sorta works
